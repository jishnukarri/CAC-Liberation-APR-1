/*
    - Place here the structures that you want the enemy static weapons to spawn. For that, you need:
        The classname of the building [STRING], followed by an bigger array;
        The type of the static weapon ("RAISED-HMG", "LOWERED-HMG", "RAISED-GMG", "LOWERED-GMG", "AT", "AA") [ARRAY], related to ones in the presets. Can be more than one. Recommended: one type per position;
        The PositionRelative coordinates [ARRAY] where the static weapon will spawn, relative to the structure;
        The direction of the weapon [NUMBER] (it will be relative to the object).
    - Example:
        - [STRING, [[[STRING], ARRAY, NUMBER]]]
        - ["building_classname", [[["type"], [relative position], relative direction], [["RAISED-HMG", "AT", "AA"], [x,y,z], (+/- dir)], [["RAISED-HMG"], [-1.14307,-1.2998,-0.55952], (180)]]]
    - To get positionRelative, stand your character where you want to static weapon to spawn and run the code below in debug, it will return a [x,y,z] array. 
        (varNameOfTheObject or cursorObject) worldToModel ASLToAGL getPosASL player
    - Using modded static weapons may require small adjustments in relative positions.
    - To open the possibility of spawning static weapons, it requires more editing by placing those buildings classnames referenced below in the map. Some building classes may be already in the map.
    - The static weapons will only spawn near sectors, so place the garrisons buildings near them.
    - Don't duplicate classnames.
    - Be careful when making a new array. Copy an example and change the values, and then check for missing or additional commas.
